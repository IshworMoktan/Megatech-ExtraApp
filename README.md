# Task Summary
I was tasked with building a Flutter application adhering to Material UI3 design principles. The app needed to implement state management using BLoC and Flutter's built-in state management, utilize shared_preferences for data caching, gracefully handle exceptions and errors, incorporate animations and motion graphics, and optimize the app's size.
